description: Generate TMDB image URLs for posters, backdrops, profiles, logos, and stills.
---


The `ImageAPI` class allows you to generate fully qualified TMDB image URLs from relative image paths using typed convenience methods.
These URLs respect your configuration preferences, such as whether to use HTTPS and which image size to use by default, as long as you don't override them.

## Available Methods

| Method      | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `poster(path, size?)`   | Build a full image URL for a movie poster |
| `backdrop(path, size?)` | Build a full image URL for a movie backdrop |
| `logo(path, size?)`     | Build a full image URL for a production company or network logo |
| `profile(path, size?)`  | Build a full image URL for a personâ€™s profile photo |
| `still(path, size?)`    | Build a full image URL for a video still or frame |

All methods return a string containing the full image URL.

## Usage Example

```ts
const url = tmdb.images.poster("/xGuOF1T3WmPsAcQEQJfnG7Ud9f8.jpg");
console.log(url); // https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/xGuOF1T3WmPsAcQEQJfnG7Ud9f8.jpg

const url = tmdb.images.poster("/xGuOF1T3WmPsAcQEQJfnG7Ud9f8.jpg", "original");
console.log(url); // https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original/xGuOF1T3WmPsAcQEQJfnG7Ud9f8.jpg
```

## Configuration Options

As described in the [Configuration](/docs/configuration) section, you can optionally define default images sizes to use; or whether to use secure-urls or not.

```ts
type ImagesConfig = {
  secure_images_url?: boolean; // default: true
  default_image_sizes?: {
    posters?: PosterSize;
    backdrops?: BackdropSize;
    logos?: LogoSize;
    profiles?: ProfileSize;
    still?: StillSize;
  };
}
```

This allows you to:
- Use `http://` instead of `https://` (not recommended)
- Set default sizes for each image type (overridable per call)

---

## Notes

- If no size is passed to a method, the corresponding default size from config is used.
- If no config is provided, the following defaults are used:
  - Posters: `w500`
  - Backdrops: `w780`
  - Logos: `w185`
  - Profiles: `w185`
  - Stills: `w300`
